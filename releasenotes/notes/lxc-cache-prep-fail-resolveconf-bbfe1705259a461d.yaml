    In the ``lxc_hosts`` role execution, we make use of the images produced
    on a daily basis by images.linuxcontainers.org. Recent changes in the
    way those images are produced have resulted in changes to the default
    ``/etc/resolve.conf`` in that default image. As such, when executing
    the cache preparation it fails. For ocata releases prior to 15.1.21 the
    workaround to get past the error is to add the following to the
    ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml`` file.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      lxc_cache_prep_pre_commands: "rm -f /etc/resolv.conf || true"
      lxc_cache_prep_post_commands: "ln -s ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf -f"
